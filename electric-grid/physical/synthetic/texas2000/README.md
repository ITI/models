# Overview
## Texas 2000-June 2016
This 2000 bus power system test case is entirely synthetic, built from public information and a statistical analysis of real power systems.  It bears no relation to the actual grid in this location, except that generation and load profiles are similar, based on public data. A spreadsheet document contains the caseâ€™s specifications, including the areas, substations, buses, lines, transformers, generators, loads, and shunt devices. Benchmark power flow solutions are also given. The case is also provided in PowerWorld format, Matpower format, PSS/E raw format, and GE PSLF epc format.
