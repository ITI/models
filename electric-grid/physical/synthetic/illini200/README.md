# Overview
## Illinois200
The Illinois200 case (also known as the ACTIVSg200 case) is a 200 bus power system  test case that is entirely synthetic, built from public information and a statistical  analysis of real power systems. It bears no relation to the actual grid in this location, except that generation and load profiles are similar.

The case is provided in PowerWorld format, Matpower format, PSS/E raw format, and GE PSLF epc format, along with the corresponding files for the transient stability models.

Please contact Adam Birchfield (birchfi2@illinois.edu) for any questions regarding this case.
