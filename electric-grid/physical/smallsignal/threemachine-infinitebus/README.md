# Overview
## Three Machines Infinite Bus Benchmark System
The 3MIB benchmark system proposed in [1] is comprised of six buses and three generators. The 3-machine-infinite bus (3MIB) benchmark system is used for assessing the effectiveness of power system stabilizers to simultaneously contribute to the damping of electromechanical modes of different nature: from the intra-plant to the inter-area modes.
