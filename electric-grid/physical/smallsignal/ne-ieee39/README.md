# Overview
## New England IEEE 39-Bus System
The IEEE 39-bus system analyzed in this report is commonly known as “the 10-machine New-England Power System.” This system’s parameters are specified in a paper by T. Athay et al [1] and are published in a book titled ‘Energy Function Analysis for Power System Stability'[2]. This case is used to study simultaneous damping of local and inter-are modes in a system with a highly symmetrical structure.
