# Overview
## IEEE 39-Bus System
The “IEEE 39 bus system is well known as 10-machine New-England Power System. Generator 1 represents the aggregation of a large number of generators. All parameters shown below are taken from the book titled ‘Energy Function Analysis for Power System Stability’” [1][2]. The original paper with the IEEE 39-bus system is by T. Athay et al. [3]

The IEEE 39-bus system has 10 generators and 46 lines.
