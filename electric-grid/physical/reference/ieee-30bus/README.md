# Overview
## IEEE 30-Bus System
The IEEE 30-bus test case represents a simple approximation of the American Electric Power system as it was in December 1961 [1]. The equivalent system has 15 buses, 2 generators, and 3 synchronous condensers.

The 11 kV and 1.0 kV base voltages are guesses, and may not reflect the actual data. The model actually has these buses at either 132 or 33 kV; what is worth mentioning is that the 30-bus test case does not have line limits [1].
